# BankApp

> Initial commit – first step towards a microservice-based banking application.

This repository represents the **starting point** of my journey in building a full microservice architecture for a banking application.  

At this stage, the project is primarily structured, with the backend Spring Boot service set up, but the core features are still in development.  

## Purpose

This project is a learning and development playground for exploring:

- Microservice architecture with Spring Boot
- Service separation and modular design
- Secure handling of sensitive data (`.env` files)
- Building scalable, maintainable backend systems

## Next Steps

- Expand backend functionality
- Implement additional microservices
- Connect services with REST APIs
- Add frontend and integrate full-stack features

*This is just the beginning — the foundation for a larger, production-ready banking system.*
